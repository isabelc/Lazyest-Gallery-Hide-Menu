Lazyest Gallery Hide Menu
=========================

This WordPress plugin is an extension for [Lazyest Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/lazyest-gallery/) that hides the "Lazyest Gallery" menu item from the admin dashboard area from all users except administrators. This helps prevent Contributors, Authors, and Editors from deleting your pictures. It works immediately upon activation.

Please note that this only hides the menu, it does not alter actual "capabilities". From the WordPress codex: "Please be aware that this would not prevent a user from accessing these screens directly. Removing a menu does not replace the need to filter a user's permissions as appropriate."
